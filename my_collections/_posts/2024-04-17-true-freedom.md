          True freedom lies within the constructs of society, <br>
          Where harmony and order foster unity. <br>
          For in the bonds we share, we find our strength, <br>
          A collective purpose that extends its length. <br><br>
          
          Society's fabric weaves a tapestry of rights, <br>
          Balancing freedom with responsibility's light. <br>
          It provides a framework to nurture growth, <br>
          Where diverse voices can flourish, both bold and loath. <br><br>
          
          Within the constructs, laws and norms reside, <br>
          Guiding our actions, shaping the tide. <br>
          They set boundaries, ensuring fairness and peace, <br>
          Allowing freedoms to coexist and increase. <br><br>
          
          True freedom thrives when respect is the guide, <br>
          Embracing differences, standing side by side. <br>
          It's not anarchy or chaos unbound, <br>
          But a tapestry of rights where liberties are found. <br><br>
          
          Within society's structures, we find our voice, <br>
          Advocating change, making a choice. <br>
          Together we build, progress, and transform, <br>
          Challenging injustice, nurturing reform. <br><br>
          
          So let us recognize the power we hold, <br>
          To shape the constructs with stories untold. <br>
          For true freedom lies not in isolation's domain, <br>
          But in the shared endeavor where humanity can reign.
